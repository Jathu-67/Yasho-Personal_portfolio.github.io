This is a portfolio about my acting career.This is about my acting and modeling skills.

Clients can contact me if they need to join.So from this website I allow some features to contact me for my fans by sending messages including their name and email. And they can follow me from social media also.

About website sturcture :  I used html,css, javascript and php to create my website and connect it with the database over a server.
 
Database information To link my database to my website, I utilized xampp server. In PhpMyAdmin on the xampp server, I established my database.One table was made specifically to collect information about fans' name and email. The database will add those facts to the table when you complete the form.

This is a localhost server, thus installing it on your device is required before you can use the localhost address to access a website and check the database.
